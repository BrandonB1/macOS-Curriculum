# macOS-Curriculum

Over the years, as Apple's attention has shifted primarily towards iOS (often at the expense of macOS) the quality of the documentation has become obtuse and outdated.

This project seeks to fix this in a number of ways:

1. Provide a macOS Development Curriculum, if you will. The goal is to turn the haphazardly organized, bizarrely cited Documentation some structure and clarity.
2. Modernize the code snippets (currently written in Objective-C) by rewriting them in Swift, against the current (macOS High Sierra) APIs.
3. Annotate / Update outdated parts of the Documentation to bring it in line with the current OS.
To do this correctly, it will take both time and collaboration.

Time because though it is criminally outdated, Apple's Documentation is comprehensive.

Collaboration because I only started Mac Programming 3 years ago, it was never full time, and there are still many things that I wouldn't trust myself to write new Documentation for.

**This is where you come in:** Doing any of the following would greatly help to ensure the project's success, and bring joy to millions of documentation deprived developers this holiday season:

+ **Contribute**: I can't stress enough how vital it is that experienced eyes review these Documentation changes. But even if you're not an experienced macOS developer, there is plenty of work you can do to help: from taking updated screenshots, to checking grammar, or writing tests, *Any Pull Requests Are Greatly Appreciated!*
+ **Share**: If you can't contribute, then please considerSharing this project; the more the merrier!
